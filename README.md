For this project, I built a maze solver in C++ using recursion and backtracking. The idea was to start at the top-left corner of a 2D grid maze and find a path to the bottom-right corner, marking the path along the way. I represented the maze with a 2D array where open spaces are 0, walls are 1, and any path found is marked as 2. My main approach was to try moving in each direction (right, down, left, and up) recursively from each cell, and if a move didn’t work, I’d backtrack by resetting that cell and trying a different direction.

One of the biggest challenges was handling the boundaries and preventing the function from looping infinitely. At first, I was getting segmentation faults because the recursive function would sometimes try to access cells outside the array boundaries. I fixed this by adding boundary checks right at the start of the function. Another tricky part was making sure that the solver didn’t keep revisiting cells it already marked as part of the solution path, which would also lead to infinite loops. Once I added a check to avoid revisiting marked cells, everything ran smoothly, and it was pretty satisfying to watch the maze path print out correctly!
